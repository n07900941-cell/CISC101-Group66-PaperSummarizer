# Module 2 – Section Loop (Updated)

### Variable
- `summary_level`: determines how detailed each section summary should be.

### Behavior
- If `summary_level = "short"` → Generate a compact summary of 1–2 sentences per section.  
- If `summary_level = "detailed"` → Generate a short paragraph **plus** a bullet list of 3–5 key points per section.  

### Notes
- Maintain consistency with PS2 input/output formats.  
- Make sure summaries follow factuality rules and integrate with Guardrails.
