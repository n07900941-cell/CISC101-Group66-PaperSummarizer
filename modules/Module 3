# Module 3 – Guardrails (Updated)

### New Feature 1: Strict Evidence Mode
- Introduce variable `evidence_mode` with possible value `"strict"`.  
- When `evidence_mode = "strict"`:
  - Include only claims, equations, and results **explicitly** found in the provided text.  
  - If not enough information is available, output:
    > “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”

### New Feature 2: Section Warning Messages
- If a section is missing, empty, or too short (< 50 words), generate a **standardized warning message**, e.g.:
  - “Section skipped: no usable text was provided.”  
  - “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”
